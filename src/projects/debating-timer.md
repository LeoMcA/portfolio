Created while co-chair of my secondary school's debating society, to automate the duties of the timekeeper.

The app works best projected on a whiteboard, and sounds a bell at the start and end of protected time, and the end of allocated time for a speech. The lengths of these are configurable, set to british parliamentary timings by default.

It received much use during my time at school, and I've used it beyond, allowing me to completely focus on judging debates rather than having to keep one eye on the clock at all times.
