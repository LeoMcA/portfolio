Created during my second year at UCL in a team in collaboration with [GOSH DRIVE](https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/news/latest-press-releases/new-unit-opening-great-ormond-street-hospital-set-revolutionise-how-technology-used-hospitals).

I worked primarily on how we displayed our prototype app working in its environment, by building an interactive web demo that simulated the "real world" outside of the confines of the virtual phone screen shown. This required some simple JavaScript, but mostly advanced CSS techniques to control the layout and add animation to make the demo seem believable.

I also took a lead role in coordinating our development efforts, and recording and narrating our demo video.
